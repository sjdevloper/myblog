## There are five different  position values:

- static
- relative
- fixed
- absolute
- sticky

1. HTML elements are positioned static by default

2. Relative is positioned relative to its normal position.

3. Fixed is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

4. Position absolute is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

5. Sticky is position based on the user's scroll position.
